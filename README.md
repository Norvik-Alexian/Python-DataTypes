# Summarization

## Tuple:
Tuple is immutable sequence of objects, and it's unmodifiable (immutable) list.
if tuple contains only one element we should place comma after it.

tuple.index(object) - find first object occurance.

tuple.count(object) - occurance number of object in tuple.

Object from list can be mutable.

## Sets:
Set is unordered collection of unique unmodifiable (immutable) object.
Set can also be created from other object using `set()` function.

Set support different operations unique for sets:
* x & y - intersection
* x | y - unite
* x - y - subtraction

Set can be considered as dictionary without values (only with keys).

We can add element to set or to remove an element, we can iterat over set and sets support comprehension expression.
We can create subsets using frozenset.
